      <hr>
      <p class="px-5 py-3 h5">
        &emsp;An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip
        past one another. The surface where they slip is called the fault or
        fault plane. The location below the earth’s surface where the earthquake
        starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on
        the surface of the earth is called the epicenter. Sometimes an
        earthquake has foreshocks. These are smaller earthquakes that happen in
        the same place as the larger earthquake that follows. Scientists can’t
        tell that an earthquake is a foreshock until the larger earthquake
        happens. The largest, main earthquake is called the mainshock.
        Mainshocks always have aftershocks that follow. These are smaller
        earthquakes that occur afterwards in the same place as the mainshock.
        Depending on the size of the mainshock, aftershocks can continue for
        weeks, months, and even years after the mainshock!

                &emsp;The earth has four major layers: the inner core, outer core,
              mantle and crust. The crust and the top of the mantle make up a
              thin skin on the surface of our planet. But this skin is not all
              in one piece – it is made up of many pieces like a puzzle covering
              the surface of the earth. Not only that, but these puzzle pieces
              keep slowly moving around, sliding past one another and bumping
              into each other. We call these puzzle pieces tectonic plates, and
              the edges of the plates are called the plate boundaries. The plate
              boundaries are made up of many faults, and most of the earthquakes
              around the world occur on these faults. Since the edges of the
              plates are rough, they get stuck while the rest of the plate keeps
              moving. Finally, when the plate has moved far enough, the edges
              unstick on one of the faults and there is an earthquake.

                &emsp;While the edges of faults are stuck together, and the rest of the
              block is moving, the energy that would normally cause the blocks
              to slide past one another is being stored up. When the force of
              the moving blocks finally overcomes the friction of the jagged
              edges of the fault and it unsticks, all that stored up energy is
              released. The energy radiates outward from the fault in all
              directions in the form of seismic waves like ripples on a pond.
              The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it, and
              when the waves reach the earth’s surface, they shake the ground
              and anything on it, like our houses and us!

                &emsp; Earthquakes are recorded by instruments called seismographs. The
              recording they make is called a seismogram. The seismograph has a
              base that sets firmly in the ground, and a heavy weight that hangs
              free. When an earthquake causes the ground to shake, the base of
              the seismograph shakes too, but the hanging weight does not.
              Instead the spring or string that it is hanging from absorbs all
              the movement. The difference in position between the shaking part
              of the seismograph and the motionless part is what is recorded.

                &emsp; The size of an earthquake depends on the size of the fault and the
              amount of slip on the fault, but that’s not something scientists
              can simply measure with a measuring tape since faults are many
              kilometers deep beneath the earth’s surface. So how do they
              measure an earthquake? They use the seismogram recordings made on
              the seismographs at the surface of the earth to determine how
              large the earthquake was. A short wiggly line that doesn’t wiggle
              very much means a small earthquake, and a long wiggly line that
              wiggles a lot means a large earthquake. The length of the wiggle
              depends on the size of the fault, and the size of the wiggle
              depends on the amount of slip. The size of the earthquake is
              called its magnitude. There is one magnitude for each earthquake.
              Scientists also talk about theintensity of shaking from an
              earthquake, and this varies depending on where you are during the
              earthquake.

                &emsp;Seismograms come in handy for locating earthquakes too, and being
              able to see the P wave and the S wave is important. You learned
              how P & S waves each shake the ground in different ways as they
              travel through it. P waves are also faster than S waves, and this
              fact is what allows us to tell where an earthquake was. To
              understand how this works, let’s compare P and S waves to
              lightning and thunder. Light travels faster than sound, so during
              a thunderstorm you will first see the lightning and then you will
              hear the thunder. If you are close to the lightning, the thunder
              will boom right after the lightning, but if you are far away from
              the lightning, you can count several seconds before you hear the
              thunder. The further you are from the storm, the longer it will
              take between the lightning and the thunder.

    <h1 style="padding-left: 3.3%; padding-top: 2%">P waves</h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="px-5 py-3 h5">&emsp;
      P Waves alternately compress and stretch the crustal material parallel to
      the direction they are propagating. S Waves cause the crustal material to
      move back and forth perpendicular to the direction they are travelling. P
      waves are like the lightning, and S waves are like the thunder. The P
      waves travel faster and shake the ground where you are first. Then the S
      waves follow and shake the ground also. If you are close to the
      earthquake, the P and S wave will come one right after the other, but if
      you are far away, there will be more time between the two. By looking at
      the amount of time between the P and S wave on a seismogram recorded on a
      seismograph, scientists can tell how far away the earthquake was from that
      location. However, they can’t tell in what direction from the seismograph
      the earthquake was, only how far away it was. If they draw a circle on a
      map around the station where the radius of the circle is the determined
      distance to the earthquake, they know the earthquake lies somewhere on the
      circle. But where? Scientists then use a method called triangulation to
      determine exactly where the earthquake was (see image below). It is called
      triangulation because a triangle has three sides, and it takes three
      seismographs to locate an earthquake. If you draw a circle on a map around
      three different seismographs where the radius of each is the distance from
      that station to the earthquake, the intersection of those three circles is
      the epicenter!
